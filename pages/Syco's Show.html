                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="justify-text">Viewer engagement for America's Got Talent (AGT) and Britain's Got Talent (BGT) has declined in recent seasons, despite generally favorable attitude. Ratings reached their zenith between 2014 and 2015 due to format innovations and significant events, then had a precipitous decline in 2020 as a result of production alterations during the pandemic. On YouTube, AGT surpasses BGT in subscriber count, although BGT possesses the most-viewed video, reflecting AGT's extensive fanbase compared to BGT's episodic virality. Sentiment analysis yields a net good outcome; yet, it consistently raises concerns regarding authenticity and repetitiveness.</p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p class="justify-text">The prolonged decline is obscured by seasonal fluctuations but is seen in average viewership and platform interaction. AGT's enhanced format flexibility, characterized by more stages and procedures, is associated with superior audience prioritization, while BGT's more rigid structure demonstrates diminished retention over time. Platform diagnostics indicate certain strengths: AGT fosters greater continuous followership, whereas BGT is more susceptible to viral fluctuations. Negative descriptors such as “fake,” “boring,” “scripted", cluster around late-season material and recycled themes, indicating deficiencies non authenticity and exhaustion in narrative routes.</p>

                <h2>Suggestions</h2>
                <p class="justify-text">Revitalize the show’s frequency using season-specific dynamics (limited-run categories, rotating mini-leagues) and clear judging/storytelling to mitigate monotony and impressions of being “scripted.” Enhance audience engagement with real-time polls and save/block functionalities to augment control and trust, testing these elements in specials prior to full-season implementation. Coordinate several high-impact crossover events per cycle to revive the 2014–2015 playbook, while distinguishing platform strategy: AGT emphasizes long-form subscriber series and member exclusives, whereas BGT optimizes tent-pole, shareable moments and short-form content, with intentional cross-promotion between the two. Implement instrument modifications through A/B testing and monitor increases in views, comments, completion rates, and sentiment scores as key performance indicators.</p>
