Daily weather in South Wales was analysed using a merged historical dataset (1973–2025) spanning 17 stations and 322,983 records.
Exploratory analysis showed sizeable gaps for snow/snowdepth/solar-related fields, steady warming across seasons—most clearly in 
winter, and a post-2017 shift toward higher winter precipitation falling as rain rather than snow. 
Rain was by far the most frequent condition, consistent with rising precipitation and warmer winters. 
Correlation analysis highlighted strong links between rain and precipitation features (precip, precipprob, precipcover >0.6) 
and negative associations between clear conditions and cloud cover/humidity. For multi-label condition forecasting, 
a MultiOutputClassifier was trained with several base learners; XGBoost performed best (accuracy: 98.65%, macro-F1: 0.8085, 
precision: 0.9965), narrowly ahead of Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting, with Random Forest and Decision Trees close behind 
and LightGBM lowest among the tested models. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/manual) identified compact trees/estimators as 
effective settings. Overall, ensemble/boosting approaches proved well-suited to South Wales’ nonlinear, microclimate-influenced 
patterns, but future work could incorporate real-time/hourly data and interpretability tooling to strengthen operational use.
