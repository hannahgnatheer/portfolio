                            <h4>Data analyst</h4>
                            <p>I transform complex, messy data into clear, decision-ready intelligence. My work spans rigorous cleaning, exploratory and statistical analysis, and predictive modelling, supported by transparent methodology and reproducible workflows. I specialise in time-series and geospatial/weather analytics and present outcomes through concise narratives and executive-level visuals.</p>

                            <h4>Data Engineer</h4>
                            <p>I design and automate reliable data pipelines that make analytics accurate, timely, and auditable. Using robust data modelling and ETL/ELT practices, I build ingestion from APIs/files/databases, enforce quality checks, and document lineage and governance. Solutions are version-controlled, scalable, and ready for cloud deployment with monitoring and alerting in place.</p>
